Brief Introduction
------

"Flappy Bird" came to my life accidentally, when it was not as popular as it is now. Someone said that it was a déjà-vu of the game "Super Mario". Yet it has its completely different concept: let the small bird fly through the gap between two tubes. High popularity brings imitation. Spontaneously, versions of "Flappy Bird" were seen on the Internet, and some even let users to play arcade mode with other players online. These games provide players with new choices as well as provide me with brand new ideas. Using open-sourced resources and frameworks, I made my own game "Flappy Mario" based on HTML5 and JavaScript. Players can get scores by tapping the screen to flap Mario in order to eat mushrooms. They may eat red mushrooms that worth for 1 point and green mushrooms that worth for 5 points, avoiding from touching the stone mushrooms (they are fossils actually) and falling on to the ground.

Creativity creates novelty. Open Source is everything.
